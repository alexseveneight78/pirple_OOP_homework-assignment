OOP is a programming that works with real objects in a real world and pretends to reflect them and its relations using object oriented method. OOP pattern is the best choice when it is intended to describe a system of hierarchical relationships with all complexity of restrictions and levels of access.
A good example of project can be a CRM system for a logistic company that makes international shipments of cargoes. A CRM system includes:
-	a company structure;
-	relationships between its employees (who can give a task to an employee, who can`t, deadlines for tasks);
-	list of customers with a huge system of its values for company (credit of confidence, debts, number of orders, processing orders, completed orders, etc.);

User story for a sales manager: 
1.	My chief gave me a task via CRM to take today 5 orders from 3 customers (CRUD-operation: `create` - a chief creates a message with a detailed description of task; `read` - sales manager reads it and `update` notices that he took the task to work, `delete` - sales manager completed the task).
2.	While confirming 2 orders for 1 of 3 customers a credit of confidence was exceeded and I couldn`t confirm these orders for a customer. 
3.	I made a task for an accountant to make 3 invoices for customers.
